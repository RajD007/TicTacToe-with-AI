# TicTacToe-with-AI
This is my first project, created while learning at Hyperskills | JetBrains Academy

The program allows the user to play Tic Tac Toe with a bot (Easy, Medium, Hard - Undefeatable). You could also play with another human player or make the bots play each other. It is a basic version the game as I have just begun learning about object-orientated programming. Go on and play it, more instruction are provided after the game is started. 

If you have any feedback please contact me @RajD007, always welcome some critical, constructive feedback! :smile:
Enjoy the game! 

*P.S. - I am going to put through updates till I think it is at the best possible state (obviously considering my knowledge and abilities).*
