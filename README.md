# TicTacToe with AI
This is my first project, created while learning at Hyperskills | JetBrains Academy. They have the same project as part of the curriculum, but this has many more additional functionalities and in all is more user-friendly.

## For a User
The program allows the user to play Tic Tac Toe with a bot (Easy, Medium, Hard - Undefeatable). You could also play with another human player or make the bots play each other. It is a basic version the game as I have just begun learning about object-orientated programming. Go on and play it, more instruction are provided after the game is started. Feel free to provide some feedback.

**You can use the TicTacToe-with-AI.jar (path: 'build/libs/') file to quickly compile and run the game on your computer.** Enjoy the game! :partying_face:

## For a Developer
If you have any feedback please contact me @RajD007, always welcome some critical, constructive feedback on the clarity, simplicity or functionality of the code! :smile:

**The main method is in src/main/java/tictactoegame/gameboard/Main.java** | *Source directory: tictactoegame*

*P.S. - I am going to put through updates till I think it is at the best possible state (obviously considering my knowledge and abilities).*
